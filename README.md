HOW TO USE (while running):
-> q to QUIT
-> r to RELOAD (adapt to fullscreen, change character size)


NOTE 1: 
-> if expanded to the maximum the exe crashes, I'm working on a solution [this will be erased once fixed]
NOTE 2: 
-> there is no need to download the .exe file, you can download (acquarium.py, config.json), open terminal on folder you placed the two files and write:

    pyinstaller --onefile --console --add-data "config.json;." acquarium.py
